    <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni, popularly known as MS Dhoni, is one of India's greatest cricketers and most successful captains. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Jharkhand, Dhoni is renowned for his calm demeanor, sharp cricketing mind, and exceptional leadership skills. He is regarded as one of the finest wicketkeeper-batsmen in the history of the game.

        Dhoni made his international debut in 2004 and quickly gained recognition for his explosive batting and unorthodox yet effective wicketkeeping. Under his captaincy, India achieved historic milestones, including winning the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup, 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, making him the only captain to win all three major ICC white-ball tournaments.
        
        Known as "Captain Cool," Dhoni was instrumental in transforming Indian cricket, especially in limited-overs formats. His ability to remain composed under pressure and his legendary finishing skills made him one of the most feared batsmen in world cricket. Dhoni retired from international cricket on August 15, 2020, but continues to lead Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the Indian Premier League (IPL), where he remains a fan favorite.
        
        Beyond cricket, Dhoni is admired for his humility, love for the Indian Army, and passion for motorcycles. His journey from a small-town boy to a global cricketing icon continues to inspire millions.
